👋 Hi, I'm a Data Science Engineering Student
🎓 About Me

I am currently a third-year engineering student and a Master’s student in Data Science at École Polytechnique. I am pursuing a dual degree through the academic partnership between:

ENIT – National Engineering School of Tunis

ENSTA Paris – École Nationale Supérieure des Techniques Avancées

My training combines a strong background in applied mathematics, statistics, and engineering with advanced methods in data science and machine learning.

🔬 Academic & Technical Interests

📊 Data Science & Statistical Learning

🤖 Machine Learning & Neural Networks

📈 Time Series Analysis (ARIMA, Holt-Winters, forecasting)

🔗 Dependence Modeling & Extreme Value Theory (Copulas, Pickands dependence function)

🧮 Applied Probability & Mathematical Modeling

I am particularly interested in projects that bridge theoretical models and real-world data, with an emphasis on interpretability, robustness, and visualization quality.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Languages: Python, R, SQL

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Statsmodels

Data & Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, ggplot2

Scientific Computing: SciPy, RStudio

Version Control: Git, GitHub

📌 Selected Projects

📈 Time Series Forecasting
Sales data modeling using ARIMA and Holt-Winters methods with cross-validation.

🔗 Extreme Value Copulas
Neural estimation of the Pickands dependence function for Gumbel, Galambos, and Tawn copulas, with convex projection and simulation studies.

🌦️ Applied Data Science
Analysis of spatial dependence in meteorological data using extreme value theory.

🎯 Objectives

Apply advanced statistical and machine learning methods to complex real-world datasets

Pursue research-oriented or high-level applied data science projects

Continuously improve code quality, reproducibility, and visual clarity
